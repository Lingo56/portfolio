## Project Details

Final project for CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science

This was a project designed to have us utilize the data science tools we learned in class and apply them to a real world dataset. At the time I was diving deep into figuring out how to get the lowest latency possible out of my monitor. So, naturally I thought it would be perfect to gather a ton of latency data and analyize it for our final project!

In the end my partner and I gathered data using Nvidia FrameView since getting data directly from our GPUs made the data much more consistent. From there we built tools in python to analyize Nvidia's generated .csv files with various data science libraries.
