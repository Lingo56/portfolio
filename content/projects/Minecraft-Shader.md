## Project Details

Workshop built for the SFU Game Development Club

Took quite a few revisions and troubleshooting through various Minecraft forums, Discord servers, and reverse engineering existing shaders ðŸ˜…. The documentation for Minecraft shaders is very sparse as it's mostly just a handful of people writing most of them.

The other tricky thing was figuring out how to work around this and make this simple to understand and teach. I ended up using [this deconstruction of Nintendo's Wii-era water shader](https://youtu.be/8rCRsOLiO7k?si=nMAygUSA3lcX6Y1W) as a base since it's very simple to explain for its visual impact.

In the end, everyone who attended the workshop seemed very excited about their end results, so I'd say it was a success!
