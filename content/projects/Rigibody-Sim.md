## Project Details

Assignment for CMPT 466 - Animation

## Overview

{{< spacer >}}

- Rigid body simulation built using forward dynamics.
- Implemented collision detection, force/torque calculations, and semi-implicit integration for accurate object
  dynamics.
- Adjusted various physics parameters (mass, spring constant, damping, friction) to match Unity’s physics engine.
