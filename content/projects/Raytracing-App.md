## Project Details

- Optimized a Monte Carlo ray tracer with C++ expression templates and a quasi-random algorithm for improved performance and visual quality.
- Rewrote ray tracing algorithm for multithreading and distributed computing, allowing significant performance gains over the original single-threaded implementation.
