## Project Details

Semester Project for the CDM Digital Media Practicum

A social networking platform for alumni browsing and networking. Designed from the ground up to be visually engaging and create a new visual language for the CDM as a brand.

Built with a team of designers and programmers at the CDM. We had our own complexities come up with the team makeup which led us from having a flat structure mid-way through the semester. In the end, however, everyone invloved loved the final result!

## Overview

- Led Unity development, graphics, and team coordination, advising designers on the technical boundaries of their concepts.
- Collaborated with CDM IT to build real-time networking and connect Unity with a remote MySQL (MariaDB) alumni database.
- Developed custom shaders and smooth camera transitions to meet designer concepts.
