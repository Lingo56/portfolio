## Project Details

- Guided team through Unity development, providing key insights for crafting shaders and UI, resulting in a visually engaging and informative user experience.
- Implemented a robust networking solution to seamlessly connect with a remote MariaDB database, facilitating real-time server access to alumni data.
- Overcame challenges of mismanagement by restructuring the team, adopting a flat structure, and improving communication between developers, designers, and clients.
- Developed a star shader inspired by Pixar's "Inside Out," iterating through multiple designs to meet the designer's vision.
- Integrated Cinemachine for smooth camera transitions, enhancing the app's polished feel.
- Delivered three main outputs:
  1. **Unity-Based Alumni App**: A polished MVP focusing on high-quality presentation.
  2. **Alumni Database**: A partially complete database with gaps in alumni data.
  3. **Web Visualization**: A basic React-based visualization hosted on the CDM's web stack.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Adapted to unclear project direction and solved problems without direct guides, improving confidence in tackling unknowns.
- Enhanced communication skills by collaborating with a diverse team of designers and clients unfamiliar with 3D development.
- Addressed technical challenges, such as integrating Unity with a database and creating performant shaders.
