## Project Details

Semester Project for the CDM Digital Media Practicum

A social networking platform for alumni browsing and networking. Designed from the ground up to be visually engaging and create a new visual language for the CDM as a brand.

Built with a team of 7, which dropped to 6 mid-project. This ended up being it's own challenge since the member who left was the project manager. Our team needed to adjust on the fly to organizing around a flat structure.

## Overview

- Collaborated with CDM IT to build real-time networking and connect Unity with a remote MySQL (MariaDB) alumni database.
- Developed custom shaders and s0mooth camera transitions to meet designer concepts.
